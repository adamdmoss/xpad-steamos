NOTE: I'm not updating this version any more (unless people really want me to); instead see the cleaner better xpad.c in my steamos_kernel fork : https://github.com/adamdmoss/steamos_kernel

This is a version of the xpad (xbox360 controller etc.) driver with more reliable LED support and more stability compared to the versions in Ubuntu 14.04 or SteamOS (at the time of writing).
